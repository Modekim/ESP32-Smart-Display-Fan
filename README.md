## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the ESP32-Smart-Display-Fan project! This guide will help you download and run the application with ease. 

## 💡 What Is This Project?
The ESP32-Smart-Display-Fan is a self-contained device designed to enhance your home comfort using technology. It has an OLED display that shows temperature, humidity, and pressure pulled from Home Assistant through a communication method called MQTT. The internal temperature is measured with a DS18B20 sensor. Additionally, the ESP32 microcontroller controls a fan, ensuring your space stays cool without overheating.

To run the ESP32-Smart-Display-Fan, your setup will require:

- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- A stable internet connection for downloading
- Basic USB port for connecting hardware

## 🔗 Features
- Displays temperature, humidity, and pressure
- Uses MQTT for home automation
- Measures internal temperature with a DS18B20 sensor
- Controls a fan with N-MOSFET
- Hysteresis to prevent overheating
